								<P>
								&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSalvation through Jesus Christ is the main topic of the New Testament of the Bible. 
								The bible tells us, at the beginning God created Man in his own image; he created 
								him male and female. (Gen 1: 27) <font id="sa_font2">"So God created man in his own image, in the image 
								of God created he him; male and female created he them."</font> God wanted man to have fellowship 
								with him and know him personally so he could live with him in full happiness. But the
								first man Adam rebelled against God; he disobeyed his commandments. Therefore he became 
								a sinner. When Adam sinned Sin entered into the world and sin brought death, and death 
								spread to everyone. (Rom 5:12) <font id="sa_font2">"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and 
								death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned"</font>. Because of this, 
								Mankind was separated from his loving God forever. We all became lost to God. We all inherited a
								corrupt human nature. We all became rebels against God. (Roman 3:23) <font id="sa_font2">"for all have sinned and 
								fall short of the glory of God "</font>. 
								</P>
								<p>&nbsp</p>
								<p>
								&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBut God loved us so much he prepared a way to bring us close to him again. 
								He gave his only begotten son to die for our sin on the cross. (John 3:16) 
								<font id="sa_font2"> "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever 
								believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life'</font>. Jesus became our 
								redeemer. Through his sacrifice (through his blood) we receive forgiveness of sin. 
								(Eph 1:7)<font id="sa_font2"> "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, 
								according to the riches of his grace;"</font> only through him we can come to the father. 
								(John 14: 6) <font id="sa_font2"> "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man 
								cometh unto the Father, but by me"</font>.  God will accept us only if we come through him. 
								There is no other way. 								
								</p>
								<p>&nbsp</p>
								
								<p>								
								&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf we want to be close to God, receive his forgiveness and become his child we have to take these four important steps:
