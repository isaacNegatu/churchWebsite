												<li>
													<p id="p4">There is one God, who is infinitely perfect,
														existing eternally in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy
														Spirit.</p>
												</li>
												<p id="p2">Deuteronomy 6:4, Matthew 5:48, Matthew 28:19</p>
												
												<br>
												<li>
													<p id="p4">Jesus Christ is the true God and the true man.
														He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin
														Mary. He died upon the cross, the Just for the unjust, as
														a substitutionary sacrifice, and all who believe in Him
														are justified on the ground of His shed blood. He arose
														from the dead according to the Scriptures. He is now at
														the right hand of Majesty on high as our great High
														Priest. He will come again to establish His kingdom,
														righteousness and peace.</p>
												</li>
												<p id="p2">Philippians 2: 6-11, Luke 1:34-38, 1 Peter
														3:18, Hebrews 2:9, Romans 5:9, Acts 2:23-24, Hebrews 8:1,
														Matthew 26:64</p> 
												<br>
												<li>
													<p id="p4">The Holy Spirit is a divine person, sent to
														indwell, guide, teach, empower the believer, and convince
														the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. It is
														the will of God that each believer should be filled with
														the Holy Spirit and be sanctified wholly, being separated
														from sin and the world and fully dedicated to the will of
														God, thereby receiving power for holy living and effective
														service. This is both a crisis and a progressive
														experience wrought in the life of the believer subsequent
														to conversion.</p>
												</li>
												<p id="p2">John 14:15-18, John 16:13; Acts 1:8, John
														16:7-11</p> 
												<br>
												<li>
													<p id="p4">The Old and New Testaments, inerrant as
														originally given, were verbally inspired by God and are a
														complete revelation of His will for the salvation of men.
														They constitute the divine and only rule of Christian
														faith and practice</p>
												</li>
												<p id="p2">2 Peter 1:20-21; 2 Timothy 3:15-16</p>
												<br>
												<li>
													<p id="p4">Man was originally created in the image and
														likeness of God: he fell through disobedience, incurring
														thereby both physical and spiritual death. All men are
														born with a sinful nature, are separated from the life of
														God, and can be saved only through the atoning work of the
														Lord Jesus Christ. The portion of the unrepentant and
														unbelieving is existence forever in conscious torment; and
														that of the believer, in everlasting joy and bliss.</p>
												</li>
												<p id="p2">Genesis 1:27, Romans 3:23</p> 
												<br>
												<li>
													<p id="p4">Marriage is between one man and one woman as God
														originally designed and marriage vow is to be maintained
														to the last unless the other party is taken in
														fornication/adultery</p>
												</li>
												<p id="p2">Genesis 1:26-28; 2:18-24; Mat 19:3-9</p> 
												<br>
												<li>
													<p id="p4">Salvation has been provided through Jesus Christ
														for all men/women; and those who repent and believe in Him
														are born again of the Holy Spirit, receive the gift of
														eternal life, and become the children of God.</p>
												</li>
												<p id="p2">1 Corinthians 15:20-23, Revelation 21:8,
														Revelation 21:1-4, Titus 3:4-7, 1 Thessalonians 5:23, Acts
														1:8, Romans 6:1-14</p> </i>
												<br>
												<li>
													<p id="p4">Provision is made in the redemptive work of the
														Lord Jesus Christ for the healing of the mortal body.
														Prayer for the sick and anointing with oil are taught in
														the Scriptures and are privileges for the Church in this
														present age</p>
												</li>
												<p id="p2">Matthew 8:16-17, James 5:13-16</p> </i>
												<br>
												<li>
													<p id="p4">The Church consists of all those who believe on
														the Lord Jesus Christ, are redeemed through His blood, and
														are born again of the Holy Spirit. Christ is the Head of
														the Body, the Church, which has been commissioned by Him
														to go into the whole world as a witness, preaching the
														gospel to all nations. The local church is a body of
														believers in Christ who are joined together for the
														worship of God, for edification through the Word of God,
														for prayer, fellowship, the proclamation of the gospel,
														and observance of the ordinances of Baptism and the
														Lord&apos;s Supper.</p>
												</li>
												<p id="p2">Ephesians 1:22-23, Matthew 28:19-20, Acts
														2:41-47</p> </i>
												<br>
												<li>
													<p id="p4">There shall be a bodily resurrection of the just
														and of the unjust; for the former, a resurrection unto
														life; for the latter, a resurrection unto judgment.</p>
												</li>
												<p id="p2">1 Corinthians 15:20-23, John 5:28-29</p> </i>
												<br>
												<li>
													<p id="p4">The second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is
														imminent and will be personal, visible, and
														pre-millennial. This is the believer&apos;s blessed hope
														and is a vital truth which is an incentive to holy living
														and faithful service</p>
